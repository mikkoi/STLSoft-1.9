STLSoft - Install

; Created:  29th March 2002

============================================================================

 STLSoft is a 100% header-only library, and so requires no building.
 (Please see below if your project uses CMake.)

 It is recommended that you define an STLSOFT environment variable.
 
 For example, if you're using UNIX and you install
  to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.9.131 then you should set the environment
  variable STLSOFT to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.9.131 in which case the
  file stlsoft/stlsoft.h will be located in
  $STLSOFT/include/stlsoft/stlsoft.h
  
 Conversely, if you're using Windows and you intall
  to C:\3pty\STLSoft\stlsoft-1.9.131 then you should set the environment
  variable STLSoft to C:\3pty\STLSoft\stlsoft-1.9.131 in which case the
  file stlsoft/stlsoft.h will be located in
  C:\3pty\STLSoft\stlsoft-1.9.131\stlsoft\stlsoft.h

 The makefiles / project files of several other open-source projects expect
 this symbol, including:

  * b64             http://github.com/synesissoftware/b64
  * CLASP           http://github.com/synesissoftware/CLASP
  * FastFormat      http://github.com/synesissoftware/FastFormat
  * flecxx          http://flecxx.org/
  * libCLImate      http://github.com/synesissoftware/libCLImate
  * Open-RJ         http://openrj.org/
  * Pantheios       http://github.com/synesissoftware/Pantheios
  * recls           http://github.com/synesissoftware/recls
  * shwild          http://shwild.org/
  * VOLE            http://github.com/synesissoftware/VOLE
  * xContract       http://xcontract.org/
  * xCover          http://xcover.org/
  * xTests          http://xtests.org/

 If you're using STLSoft on UNIX, you might want to apply dos2unix over all
 the files before using it. You *must* do this if you're using the SunPro
 C compiler.

 NOTE: If you're using STLSoft 1.10 in alpha (delta) form, please consult
    FAQ #6 in the accompanying FAQ.txt file.


 CMake Users
 If your project uses CMake (https://cmake.org/) as its build tool,
 you can install STLSoft as you would any other CMake project:
 1. cd stlsoft-1.9.125
 2. mkdir build && cd build
 3. cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir_to_copy_includes>
 3. make install
 Installing STLSoft is not necessary for using it.

 When using STLSoft in your own project, add these rows to your CMakeLists.txt:
 find_package(STLSoft 1.9.125 REQUIRED)
 include_directories (${STLSoft_INCLUDE_DIRS})

 If you ran 'cmake' as stated above, then the location of STLSoft is
 automatically known to CMake.
 (Cached in User's home directory; ~/.cmake/packages/STLSoft/ in Unix).
